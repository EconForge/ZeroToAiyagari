### Consumption Savings

- Setup
    - $e_t$ is an i.i.d. process
    - $w$ and $r$ are two exogenous scalars
    - Utility function $U(c) = \frac{c^ {1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma}$ with $\gamma>1$
    - Discount factor $\beta\in [0,1[$

- Transition equation: $$a_t = w e_t + r a_{t-1} - c_t$$

- Objective: $$\max_{0 \leq c_t \leq w e_t + r a_{t-1}} \sum \beta^t U(c_t)$$
